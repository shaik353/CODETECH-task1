Project Description: Basic To-Do List Application

The Basic To-Do List Application is a simple web app built with React, designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. This project provides a hands-on experience 
with the fundamentals of React, including components, state management, and event handling, while also covering basic styling techniques with CSS.

Key Features:
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list. Each task will have a description and can be added dynamically through a form input.
Edit Tasks: Users can edit existing tasks. This allows them to correct mistakes or update the task description as needed.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list once they are completed or if they are no longer needed.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as completed. The completed tasks will be visually differentiated, typically by striking through the task text or changing the 
background color.
Filter Tasks: Tasks can be filtered based on their completion status. Users can view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks.
Basic Styling with CSS: The app includes simple CSS for a clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a pleasant user experience.
Learning Goals:
React Components: Understanding functional components and how to structure them in a React application.
State Management: Managing the application state using React's useState hook to keep track of tasks and their status.
Event Handling: Handling user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and state updates.
Conditional Rendering: Displaying tasks based on their completion status (e.g., completed or pending).
Basic CSS Styling: Styling the app to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
Technologies Used:
React: For building the user interface and managing application state.
CSS: For styling the app, ensuring responsiveness and a clean design.
This project serves as a great way to dive into React, especially for beginners. It demonstrates how to manage dynamic data and respond to user actions, providing a strong 
foundation for more complex applications in the future.
